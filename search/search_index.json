AddCap ( config = { // config.XXX }); The services is IServiceCollection interface\uff0cwhich is under the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection . If you don't want to use Microsoft's IoC container, you can view ASP.NET Core documentation here to learn how to replace the default container implementation. What is the minimum configuration? The simplest answer is that at least you have to configure a transport and a storage. If you want to get started quickly you can use the following configuration: services . AddCap ( capOptions = { capOptions . UseInMemoryQueue (); capOptions . UseInmemoryStorage (); }); For specific transport and storage configuration, you can view the configuration items provided by the specific components in the Transports section and the Persistent section. Custom configuration The CapOptions is used to store configuration information. By default they have the default values, and sometimes you may need to customize them. DefaultGroup Default: cap.queue.{assembly name} The default consumer group name, corresponding to different names in different Transports, you can customize this value to customize the names in Transports for easy viewing. Mapping Map to Queue Names in RabbitMQ. Map to Topic Name in Apache Kafka. Map to Subscription Name in Azure Service Bus. Version Default: v1 This is a new configuration item introduced in the CAP v2.4 version. It is used to specify a version of a message to isolate messages of different versions of the service. It is often used in A/B testing or multi-service version scenarios. The following is its application scenario: Business Iterative and compatible Due to the rapid iteration of services, the data structure of the message is not fixed during each service integration process. Sometimes we add or modify certain data structures to accommodate the newly introduced requirements. If you're a brand new system, there's no problem, but if your system is deployed to a production environment and serves customers, this will cause new features to be incompatible with the old data structure when they go online, and then these changes can cause serious problems. To work around this issue, you can only clean up message queues and persistent messages before starting the application, which is obviously fatal for production environments. Multiple versions of the server Sometimes, the server's server needs to provide multiple sets of interfaces to support different versions of the app. The data structures of the same interface and server interaction of these different versions of the app may be different, so usually the server does not provide the same. Routing addresses to adapt to different versions of App calls. Using the same persistent table/collection in different instance If you want multiple different instance services to use the same database, in versions prior to 2.4, we could isolate database tables for different instances by specifying different table names. That is to say, when configuring the CAP, it is implemented by configuring different table name prefixes. Check out the blog to learn more about Version feature: https://www.cnblogs.com/savorboard/p/cap-2-4.html FailedRetryInterval Default: 60 sec In the process of message message sent to transport failed, the CAP will be retry to sent. This configuration item is used to configure the interval between each retry. In the process of message consumption failed, the CAP will retry to execute. This configuration item is used to configure the interval between each retry. Retry Interval By default, retry will start after 4 minutes of failure to send or consume, in order to avoid possible problems caused by setting message state delays. Failures in the process of sending and consuming messages will be retried 3 times immediately, and will be retried polling after 3 times, at which point the FailedRetryInterval configuration will take effect. ConsumerThreadCount Default : 1 Number of consumer threads, when this value is greater than 1, the order of message execution cannot be guaranteed FailedRetryCount Default: 50 Maximum number of retries. When this value is reached, retry will stop and the maximum number of retries will be modified by setting this parameter. FailedThresholdCallback Default: NULL Type: Action MessageType, string, string T1 : Message Type T2 : Message Name T3 : Message Content Failure threshold callback. This action is called when the retry reaches the value set by FailedRetryCount , and you can receive the notification by specifying this parameter to make a manual intervention. For example, send an email or notify. SucceedMessageExpiredAfter Default: 24*3600 sec (1 days) The expiration time (in seconds) of the success message. When the message is sent or consumed successfully, it will be removed from persistent when the time reaches SucceedMessageExpiredAfter seconds. You can set the expiration time by specifying this value.","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"user-guide/en/cap/configuration/#configuration","text":"By default, you can specify the configuration when you register the CAP service into the IoC container for ASP.NET Core project. services .

The following is its application scenario: Business Iterative and compatible Due to the rapid iteration of services, the data structure of the message is not fixed during each service integration process. Sometimes we add or modify certain data structures to accommodate the newly introduced requirements. If you're a brand new system, there's no problem, but if your system is deployed to a production environment and serves customers, this will cause new features to be incompatible with the old data structure when they go online, and then these changes can cause serious problems. To work around this issue, you can only clean up message queues and persistent messages before starting the application, which is obviously fatal for production environments. Multiple versions of the server Sometimes, the server's server needs to provide multiple sets of interfaces to support different versions of the app. The data structures of the same interface and server interaction of these different versions of the app may be different, so usually the server does not provide the same. Routing addresses to adapt to different versions of App calls. Using the same persistent table/collection in different instance If you want multiple different instance services to use the same database, in versions prior to 2.4, we could isolate database tables for different instances by specifying different table names.

Delivery guarantees 1 Before we talk about idempotency, let's talk about the delivery of messages on the consumer side. Since CAP is not a used MS DTC or other type of 2PC distributed transaction mechanism, there is a problem that at least the message is strictly delivered once. Specifically, in a message-based system, there are three possibilities: Exactly Once(*) At Most Once At Least Once Exactly once has a (*) next to it, because in the general case, it is simply not possible. At Most Once The At Most Once delivery guarantee covers the case when you are guaranteed to receive all messages either once, or maybe not at all. This type of delivery guarantee can arise from your messaging system and your code performing its actions in the following order: 1. Remove message from queue 2. Start work transaction 3. Handle message (your code) 4. Success? Yes: 1. Commit work transaction No: 1. Roll back work transaction 2. Put message back into the queue In the sunshine scenario, this is all well and good \u2013 your messages will be received, and work transactions will be committed, and you will be happy. However, the sun does not always shine, and stuff tends to fail \u2013 especially if you do enough stuff. Consider e.g. what would happen if anything fails after having performed step (1), and then \u2013 when you try to execute step (4)/(2) (i.e. put the message back into the queue) \u2013 the network was temporarily unavailable, or the message broker restarted, or the host machine decided to reboot because it had installed an update. This can be OK if it's what you want, but most things in CAP revolve around the concept of DURABLE messages, i.e. messages whose contents is just as important as the data in your database. At Least Once This delivery guarantee covers the case when you are guaranteed to receive all messages either once, or maybe more times if something has failed. It requires a slight change to the order we are executing our steps in, and it requires that the message queue system supports transactions, either in the form of the traditional begin-commit-rollback protocol (MSMQ does this), or in the form of a receive-ack-nack protocol (RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, etc. do this). Check this out \u2013 if we do this: 1. Grab lease on message in queue 2. Start work transaction 3. Handle message (your code) 4. Success? Yes: 1. Commit work transaction 2. Delete message from queue No: 1. Roll back work transaction 2. Release lease on message and the \"lease\" we grabbed on the message in step (1) is associated with an appropriate timeout, then we are guaranteed that no matter how wrong things go, we will only actually remove the message from the queue (i.e. execute step (4)/(2)) if we have successfully committed our \"work transaction\". What is a \"work transaction\"? It depends on what you're doing \ud83d\ude04 maybe it's a transaction in a relational database (which traditionally have pretty good support in this regard), maybe it's a transaction in a document database that happens to support transaction (like RavenDB or Postgres), or maybe it's a conceptual transaction in the form of whichever work you happen to carry out as a consequence of handling a message, e.g. update a bunch of documents in MongoDB, move some files around in the file system, or mutate some obscure in-mem data structure. The fact that the \"work transaction\" is just a conceptual thing is what makes it impossible to support the aforementioned Exactly Once delivery guarantee \u2013 it's just not generally possible to commit or roll back a \"work transaction\" and a \"queue transaction\" (which is what we could call the protocol carried out with the message queue systems) atomically and consistently. Idempotence at CAP In the CAP, the delivery guarantees we use is At Least Once . Since we have a temporary storage medium (database table), we may be able to do At Most Once, but in order to strictly guarantee that the message will not be lost, we do not provide related functions or configurations. Why are we not providing(achieving) idempotency ? The message was successfully written, but the execution of the Consumer method failed. There are a lot of reasons why the Consumer method fails. I don't know if the specific scene is blindly retrying or not retrying is an incorrect choice. For example, if the consumer is debiting service, if the execution of the debit is successful, but fails to write the debit log, the CAP will judge that the consumer failed to execute and try again. If the client does not guarantee idempotency, the framework will retry it, which will inevitably lead to serious consequences for multiple debits. The implementation of the Consumer method succeeded, but received the same message. The scenario is also possible here. If the Consumer has been successfully executed at the beginning, but for some reason, such as the Broker recovery, and received the same message, the CAP will consider this a new after receiving the Broker message. The message will be executed again by the Consumer. Because it is a new message, the CAP cannot be idempotent at this time. The current data storage mode can not be idempotent. Since the table of the CAP message is deleted after 1 hour for the successfully consumed message, if the historical message cannot be idempotent. Historically, if the broker has maintained or manually processed some messages for some reason. Industry practices. Many event-driven frameworks require users to ensure idempotent operations, such as ENode, RocketMQ, etc... From an implementation point of view, CAP can do some less stringent idempotence, but strict idempotent cannot. Naturally idempotent message processing Generally, the best way to deal with message redeliveries is to make the processing of each message naturally idempotent. Natural idempotence arises when the processing of a message consists of calling an idempotent method on a domain object, like obj.MarkAsDeleted(); or obj.UpdatePeriod(message.NewPeriod); You can use the INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE provided by the database to easily done. Explicitly handling redeliveries Another way of making message processing idempotent, is to simply track IDs of processed messages explicitly, and then make your code handle a redelivery. Assuming that you are keeping track of message IDs by using an IMessageTracker that uses the same transactional data store as the rest of your work, your code might look somewhat like this: readonly IMessageTracker _messageTracker ; public SomeMessageHandler ( IMessageTracker messageTracker ) { _messageTracker = messageTracker ; } [CapSubscribe] public async Task Handle ( SomeMessage message ) { if ( await _messageTracker . HasProcessed ( message . Id )) { return ; } // do the work here // ... // remember that this message has been processed await _messageTracker . MarkAsProcessed ( messageId ); } As for the implementation of IMessageTracker , you can use a storage message Id such as Redis or a database and the corresponding processing state.

CAP does not directly provide out-of-the-box MS DTC or 2PC-based distributed transactions, instead we provide a solution that can be used to solve problems encountered in distributed transactions. In a distributed environment, using 2PC or DTC-based distributed transactions can be very expensive due to the overhead involved in communication, as is performance. In addition, since distributed transactions based on 2PC or DTC are also subject to the CAP theorem , it will have to give up availability (A in CAP) when network partitioning occurs. A distributed transaction is a very complex process with a lot of moving parts that can fail. Also, if these parts run on different machines or even in different data centers, the process of committing a transaction could become very long and unreliable. This could seriously affect the user experience and overall system bandwidth. So one of the best ways to solve the problem of distributed transactions is to avoid them completely . 1 For the processing of distributed transactions, CAP uses the \"Eventual Consistency and Compensation\" scheme. Eventual Consistency and Compensation 1 By far, one of the most feasible models of handling consistency across microservices is eventual consistency . This model doesn\u2019t enforce distributed ACID transactions across microservices. Instead, it proposes to use some mechanisms of ensuring that the system would be eventually consistent at some point in the future. A Case for Eventual Consistency For example, suppose we need to solve the following task: register a user profile do some automated background check that the user can actually access the system The second task is to ensure, for example, that this user wasn\u2019t banned from our servers for some reason. But it could take time, and we\u2019d like to extract it to a separate microservice. It wouldn\u2019t be reasonable to keep the user waiting for so long just to know that she was registered successfully. One way to solve it would be with a message-driven approach including compensation . Let\u2019s consider the following architecture: the user microservice tasked with registering a user profile the validation microservice tasked with doing a background check the messaging platform that supports persistent queues The messaging platform could ensure that the messages sent by the microservices are persisted. Then they would be delivered at a later time if the receiver weren\u2019t currently available Happy Scenario In this architecture, a happy scenario would be: the user microservice registers a user, saving information about her in its local database the user microservice marks this user with a flag. It could signify that this user hasn\u2019t yet been validated and doesn\u2019t have access to full system functionality a confirmation of registration is sent to the user with a warning that not all functionality of the system is accessible right away the user microservice sends a message to the validation microservice to do the background check of a user the validation microservice runs the background check and sends a message to the user microservice with the results of the check if the results are positive, the user microservice unblocks the user if the results are negative, the user microservice deletes the user account After we\u2019ve gone through all these steps, the system should be in a consistent state. However, for some period of time, the user entity appeared to be in an incomplete state. The last step, when the user microservice removes the invalid account, is a compensation phase. Failure Scenarios Now let\u2019s consider some failure scenarios: if the validation microservice is not accessible, then the messaging platform with its persistent queue functionality ensures that the validation microservice would receive this message at some later time suppose the messaging platform fails, then the user microservice tries to send the message again at some later time, for example, by scheduled batch-processing of all users that were not yet validated if the validation microservice receives the message, validates the user but can\u2019t send the answer back due to the messaging platform failure, the validation microservice also retries sending the message at some later time if one of the messages got lost, or some other failure happened, the user microservice finds all non-validated users by scheduled batch-processing and sends requests for validation again Even if some of the messages were issued multiple times, this wouldn\u2019t affect the consistency of the data in the microservices\u2019 databases. By carefully considering all possible failure scenarios, we can ensure that our system would satisfy the conditions of eventual consistency. At the same time, we wouldn\u2019t need to deal with the costly distributed transactions. But we have to be aware that ensuring eventual consistency is a complex task. It doesn\u2019t have a single solution for all cases.

But it could take time, and we\u2019d like to extract it to a separate microservice. It wouldn\u2019t be reasonable to keep the user waiting for so long just to know that she was registered successfully. One way to solve it would be with a message-driven approach including compensation . Let\u2019s consider the following architecture: the user microservice tasked with registering a user profile the validation microservice tasked with doing a background check the messaging platform that supports persistent queues The messaging platform could ensure that the messages sent by the microservices are persisted. Then they would be delivered at a later time if the receiver weren\u2019t currently available","title":"A Case for Eventual Consistency"},{"location":"user-guide/en/cap/transactions/#happy-scenario","text":"In this architecture, a happy scenario would be: the user microservice registers a user, saving information about her in its local database the user microservice marks this user with a flag. It could signify that this user hasn\u2019t yet been validated and doesn\u2019t have access to full system functionality a confirmation of registration is sent to the user with a warning that not all functionality of the system is accessible right away the user microservice sends a message to the validation microservice to do the background check of a user the validation microservice runs the background check and sends a message to the user microservice with the results of the check if the results are positive, the user microservice unblocks the user if the results are negative, the user microservice deletes the user account After we\u2019ve gone through all these steps, the system should be in a consistent state. However, for some period of time, the user entity appeared to be in an incomplete state. The last step, when the user microservice removes the invalid account, is a compensation phase.","title":"Happy Scenario"},{"location":"user-guide/en/cap/transactions/#failure-scenarios","text":"Now let\u2019s consider some failure scenarios: if the validation microservice is not accessible, then the messaging platform with its persistent queue functionality ensures that the validation microservice would receive this message at some later time suppose the messaging platform fails, then the user microservice tries to send the message again at some later time, for example, by scheduled batch-processing of all users that were not yet validated if the validation microservice receives the message, validates the user but can\u2019t send the answer back due to the messaging platform failure, the validation microservice also retries sending the message at some later time if one of the messages got lost, or some other failure happened, the user microservice finds all non-validated users by scheduled batch-processing and sends requests for validation again Even if some of the messages were issued multiple times, this wouldn\u2019t affect the consistency of the data in the microservices\u2019 databases. By carefully considering all possible failure scenarios, we can ensure that our system would satisfy the conditions of eventual consistency. At the same time, we wouldn\u2019t need to deal with the costly distributed transactions. But we have to be aware that ensuring eventual consistency is a complex task. It doesn\u2019t have a single solution for all cases.

It helps create a microservices system that is scalable, reliable, and easy to change. In Microsoft's eShopOnContainer microservices sample project, it is recommended to use CAP as the EventBus available in the production environment. What is EventBus\uff1f An Eventbus is a mechanism that allows different components to communicate with each other without knowing about each other. A component can send an Event to the Eventbus without knowing who will pick it up or how many others will pick it up. Components can also listen to Events on an Eventbus, without knowing who sent the Events. That way, components can communicate without depending on each other. Also, it is very easy to substitute a component. As long as the new component understands the Events that are being sent and received, the other components will never know. Compared to other Service Bus or Event Bus, CAP has its own characteristics. It does not require users to implement or inherit any interface when sending messages or processing messages. It has very high flexibility. We have always believed that the appointment is greater than the configuration, so the CAP is very simple to use, very friendly to the novice, and lightweight.

CAP uses this approach to deal with the loss of messages in all environments or network anomalies.

Persistent Before sent Before the message enters the message queue, the CAP uses the local database table to persist the message, which ensures that the message is not lost when the message queue is abnormal or a network error occurs. To ensure the reliability of this mechanism, CAP uses the same database transactions as the business code to ensure that business operations and CAP messages are consistent in the persistence process. That is to say, in the process of message persistence, the database will be rolled back when any one of the exceptions occurs. After sent After the message enters the message queue, the CAP will start the persistence function of the message queue. We need to explain how the CAP message is persisted in RabbitMQ and Kafka.

By default, queues registered by CAP in RabbitMQ are persistent. When used in a production environment, we recommend that you start all consumers once to create the queues with persistence, which ensures that all queues are created before the message is sent.
